    It was a Thursday morning when her friend Vanessa visited. Vanessa has been her close friend for about ten years now. 
    They met during their second year at the university. They shared the same bunk in the hostel throughout their stay 
    at the university. Vanessa is a divorcee with one child and still looked as beautiful as ever.
    Mrs. John was elated to see her friend even though it was a surprise. She hugged her friend and kissed her on the 
    lips for more than ninety seconds.
    They missed themselves too much to care about anything. Mrs. John went to the bar, brought a bottle of her 
    favourite whiskey, and poured it for herself and her friend. They sat in the sitting room drinking and trying to 
    catch up with what has happened these past months that they haven’t seen each other.
    Finally, Mrs. john told her friend how lonely she has been. By this time, the two ladies were already tipsy, 
    and Mrs. john leaned on her friend’s shoulder as she poured out her heart.
    Vanessa rubbed her hair and massaged her shoulders as she spoke, and her friend rubbed her laps. 
    Just like a magnetic attraction, they looked at each other, and their lips meet in a passionate kiss. 
    Vanessa’s hand fell on Mrs. John’s breast while Mrs. John slipped her hand deeper underneath her friend’s gown.
